### Outstanding tasks.

* Outstanding data gaps.

* 2010 World Cup
* MLS 2012 season data.
* Gold Cup champions; non-us results/goals/lineups
* United States game location information; scattered unknown opponent lineups.
* Open Cup information is spotty; watch out for release of new Open Cup data.
* NASL lineup and goal info.
* ASL game locations/refs; lineups + goals
* CCL lineup/goal info is very weak.
* SuperLiga non-US goals/lineups
* CCC information is quite weak.
* Copa America everything - available at RSSSF
* USL-1, USL-2 2001-2003 lineups/goals; 2008-2009 lineups/goals
* ISL data incomplete.
* PDL everything.
* Everything APSL pre-1993; 1994-1995 is spotty.
* ASL2 entirely terrible.

* Fix Brooklyn Hakoah name mapping (other ASL name mappings.)
